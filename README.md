After the initial promotions we started our sessions with the developpers on 15th Nov. 2022.
In this upskilling program, we do follow IOHK course patterns.
Every week there are two sessions where we are connecting with the members for 1 hr-1.30 hr, to guide and problem-solving.
In our 1st session, we do share the course content and technicality of the course. In the 2nd session, we are checking their progress and solved their doubt and problems.
We are using GitHub, Discord, and Youtube platform to share the technical solution with our participants.
