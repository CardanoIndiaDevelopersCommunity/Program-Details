During the first month of our program, we are glad to announce that we have successfully covered the topics of Basics Haskell.
Now in this upskilling program, we have almost 30 experienced personnel in our community.
During the period of 15th Nov to 15th Dec, we covered the below chapters as part of  Haskell:
1.	Introduction to Haskell
2.	Haskell Installation (Win, Linux)
3.	Data Types (Int, Integer, Float, Bool, List, String, Double, Tuples) and their signature
4.	Conditions ( If-else Guard) and Expressions (let, where)
5.	Pattern matching
6.	Functions
7.	Recursion
8.	Intro to Type class
9.	Basic IO in Haskell
All our session has been recorded for future reference and shared in our YouTube handler.
For the above chapters, we have discussed more than 100 programs and homework which have been uploaded to GitHub week-wise.
